 */
public final class MainTickTackToe {

    /**
     * Constructor.

    public MainTickTackToe() {

     */
    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        ToePlayer player1 = new ToePlayer('x');
        ToePlayer player2 = new ToePlayer('o');
        TickTackToe gameBoard = TickTackToe.getGameBoard();
        GamePlayTTT toe = new GamePlayTTT(player1, player2, gameBoard);
        System.out.println(toe.game());
    }
}
